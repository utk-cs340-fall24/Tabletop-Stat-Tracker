## Introduction:
It can be a little overwhelming the amount of stuff to keep track of and write down in a TT game, but it doesn't have to be. With this piece of software that is what we intend to solve. Using a simple UI and non-invasive controls, we hope to create an environment that is condusive to making the entry into TT a better experience. In addition, we also hope to have returning players find our software an easy to implement solution to many different applications that were used before.

## Description:
In order to make starting the journey into tabletops easier. Players can expect to find the following:
- Player cards updated in real time
- initiative tracker for combat
- enemy tracker for combat
- dice roller for quick results
- the ability to save sessions to quickly pick up where you left off

## How to start:
To get started, the runserver.bat file should be run by the GM. This file is found in **/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/RetroRoller/runserver.bat**. After this is run, all players and the GM should go to the IP of the machine on port ***Aaron help*** on your web browser of choice. Once there, you will find a login screen asking for what kind of player you are: GM or player. After that, a session token will be needed in order to login, the session token is given by the server at boot up. Once used, you will find the main UI of the software.
