# Sprint 1

### What I planned to do
- Create a better health tracker than what was in the hello plus [#1](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/1)
- add more functions and checks to the player class that will be used for tracking players [#2](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/2)
- create functions to count death saves(both fails and sucesses)[#3](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/3)

### What I did not do
-I did not implememnt this to work with the front end; however, this was the main issue that we worked on as a group to try an implememnt, we simply need some more time in order to get this aspect of the program to work
-make it interactive

### Issues I encountered
Like mentioned above, it was quite defficult to get the front end and back end to work together. We just need a little more time in order to get this to work.
