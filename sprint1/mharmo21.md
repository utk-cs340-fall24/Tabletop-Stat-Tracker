# Sprint 1

### What I planned to do
- Create a better health tracker than what was in the hello plus [#1](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/1)
- add more functions and checks to the player class that will be used for tracking players [#2](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/2)
- create functions to count death saves(both fails and sucesses)[#3](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/3)

### What I did not do
-I did not implememnt this to work with the front end; however, this was the main issue that we worked on as a group to try an implememnt, we simply need some more time in order to get this aspect of the program to work
-make it interactive

### Issues I encountered
Like mentioned above, it was quite defficult to get the front end and back end to work together. We just need a little more time in order to get this to work. 

### Issues I worked on
Like I mentined already, I worked on three specific issues
-[#1](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/1) Fixing health tracking
-[#2](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/2) Beefed up player class
-[#3](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/3) Worked on death saves

### Files I worked on
Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/backEnd/player.cpp
Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/backEnd/player.h

### What I accomplished
I accomplished what I think is a decent amount, but with our roadblock of making the frontend and backend mesh it stifled my progress a lot more than I would have liked, however I think we are very close to getting tit to work and that will allow for a much quicker progress and much better sprints. I made the functions to track death saves and added an inventory to add items, remove items, and print items you have in your inventory. This will make it a lot easier to get things done on the front end as soon as we combine the two.
