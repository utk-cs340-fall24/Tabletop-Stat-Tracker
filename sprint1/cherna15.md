Cayden Hernandez, COHernandez117, Tabletop Stat Tracker

## Issues I planned to fix:
- Convert InitTracker to JavaScript for easier usage across frontend and back end. https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/16

## What I did not do:
- Added more functionality to the Initiative Tracker

## Problems I encountered:
-  Without proper connection between all aspects of our projeect, I am reluctant to add more features before we can insure those features can be properly implemented.

## Issues I worked on:
- Issues detailed above.

## Files I worked on:
- InitTracker.js

## What I accomplished:
- Converting InitTracker.cpp into JavaScript
