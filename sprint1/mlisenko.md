## Issues I planned to fix:
- Create inventory input field and add/removability feature [#14](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/14)
- Create increment/decrement buttons for attribute value [#13](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/13)
- Customizable attribute input field [#12](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/12)
- Add/remove attribute buttons [#10](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/10)
- Create "Add Player" button to display class [#8](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/8)

## What I did not do:
- This was not a specific issue that was planned but I wanted implement more icons to the indivdual player classes so that they could be more unique
- The inventory body should have an area to input how many of an item exist as in many roleplaying games you can have more than one of an item

## Problems I encountered:
- This is a problem that goes for the whole group because we are having trouble connecting the front end to the back end. We believe that html/css is the best way for us to design the front-end and it's what is most familiar to some of us,
  but we originally thought of making the back end in C++, which may have to change to more easily bridge both sides of the project.
- Once we find a way to dynamically update player values, the features worked on in future sprints should not be as confusing for us to implement on the front end and back end. 

## Issues I worked on:
- All the issues above are the ones I worked on
- I also created the general design of how things look (colors, fonts, stylings, etc.) but did not give an issue to it as it is a very general concept that is hard to specify in an issue

## Files I worked on:
- hostView/hostView.html
- hostView/hostView_stylesheet.css

## What I accomplished:
- I was able to create the general look of the game host view page. This page does not have all the functionalities implemented yet as some are more complex and reserved for later sprints, but the base features
  created allow the host to create character/player classes that can then be fleshed out with attributes and items. The attributes and items can be edited manually, added, or removed entirely. Player classes can also be removed entirely.
