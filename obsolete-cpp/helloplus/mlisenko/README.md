## Description:
The html and corresponding css files are used to create what the front end might look like for the host of a session. Not all the features are implemented but the general idea is that the host can add players, add/remove attributes, change attributes, and remove players. 

## How to Run
Make sure the html and css file are in the same directory/subfolder and then open the html file in a browser. Ideally it would be opened in chrome but it should work on other browsers.
