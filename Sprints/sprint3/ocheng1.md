# Sprint 3

Olivia Cheng, oliviaccheng, Tabletop-Stat-Tracker

### What I planned to do
* Update layout for dice roller [#34](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/34) Create layout for dice roller
* Create settings dropdown [#35](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/35)
* Revise/add graphic design features [#24](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/24) Fine-tune graphic design 

### What I did not do
* Create a profile management system for the host or player. 

### What problems I encountered
* I had trouble with click event fields from the dropdowns interfering with buttons in the middle of the screen. It was difficult to track down the areas where each button was valid to click and change them. Also, we have a lot of duplicate files, so it was a bit confusing on where to do my work. 

### Issues I worked on
* Update layout for dice roller [#34](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/34) Create layout for dice roller
* Create settings dropdown [#35](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/35)

### Files I worked on
* frontend/dice-dropdown.js
* frontend/hostview2.html
* frontend/hostView_stylesheet2.css

### What you accomplished
I reformatted the dice roller dropdown. Mike created the pngs, but I designed the layout with the dice icon inputs or the manual input. I also wrote the code for the dice roller functionality with these different kinds of input. In addition, I created the settings dropdown that so far only has the option to end the game session with a confirmation message box as well. Overall, I cleaned up the functionality of the buttons and dropdowns so that they don't interfere with each other.
