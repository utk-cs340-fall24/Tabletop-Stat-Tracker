- Group: Tabletop-Stat-Tracker (Retro Roller)

### I ssues I planned to fix:
- Fix the issue where the dice roller was rolling when you click on the dropdown and off the dropdown, instead of the roll biiton itself [#36](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/32)
- Fix the issue where we had no wat to track enemies using the UI itself[#39](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/39)
-ADD ISSUE HERE

## What I did not do:
- I was not able to completely finish the enemy tracker as I would like the enemies names to glow, similar to how the player cards do, thankfully though, this should be a very simple issue to remedy in sprint 4 and shouldn't be an issue

## Problems I encountered:
- One issue I encountered was the lack of real issues to work on, if that makes sense? As we are nearing the end of our project, its becoming harder to colabrate on issues. What I mean by that is that one issue may only be efficiently solved by two people, so while one guy is working on the networking side of things, one more will be working on the HTML, add any more guy and we've run into "too many cooks in the kitchen" kind of scenario, which has made it hard to add some functionality as a group. That's not necassarily a bad thing, just hard to find ways to contribute meaningful code

## Issues I worked on:
- All of the issues above I worked on, I also did some other work on some formatting and making some text appear more readable or make more sense in its placement.

## Files I worked on:
- hostView2_consoleLog.html
- hostView2.html


## What I accomplished:
- I accomplished making the dice roller function like it should, which was a big issue going into this sprint and I'm glad I was able to solve it
- I added the enemy list and will continue to develop more for it to make it even more viable as a way to track enemies
