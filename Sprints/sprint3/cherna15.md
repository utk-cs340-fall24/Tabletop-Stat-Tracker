## Issues I planned to fix:

## What I did not do:
- Integrate combat tracker into the multi client site.

## Problems I encountered:
-  More implementation before the server side of things were finished, but now things should be much more managable as we near completion.

## Issues I worked on:
- Issues detailed above.

## Files I worked on:
- InitTracker.js
- hostViewInit.html
- hostView_stylesheet_init.css

## What I accomplished:
