## Issues I planned to fix:
- Convert my current working code over to Javascript as the requirents and plans for the project changed project-wide
- Add more functionality to the inventory of the player as it was quite limited in its current capacity
- added more code to the front-end to get a more cohesive mesh between the front-end and the back-end

## What I did not do:
- I did not get as much functionality into the front-end as I would have liked, however that is because of the current bottle neck of getting our database working as expected, which is a multi-person endavor we are tackling more as a group rather than as an individual

## Problems I encountered:
- getting Javascript to work was a bit of an issue, since I haven't touched it since my sophomore year of high school. 
- getting the database to track values was a little diffcult; however its the newer aspect of the project and should be fixed by the next sprint.

## Issues I worked on:
- I worked on the issues I talked about above, as well as in meetings where we as a group made efforts to organize the repository mode, create new directories, and talk about the new work flow for the overall project.
