Cayden Hernandez, COHernandez117, Tabletop Stat Tracker

## Issues I planned to fix:
- Change Initiative Tracker to accomodate usage in our HTML sites. https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/30
- Support Tracker Changes into site and complete funcionality. https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/31

## What I did not do:
- Added more functionality to the Initiative Tracker

## Problems I encountered:
-  Many of the same issue as last sprint, but implementation of changes are progressing faster before we are able to complete every step of our final stage of usability.

## Issues I worked on:
- Issues detailed above.

## Files I worked on:
- InitTracker.js
- hostViewInit.html

## What I accomplished:
- Injected my back end JavaScript into the HTML site.
- Completed partial functionality into the site.
