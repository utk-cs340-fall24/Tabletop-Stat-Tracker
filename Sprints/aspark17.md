### Issues I planned to fix:
- Configure Websockets to transfer data [#4](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/4)
- Read player names and IPs[#42](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/42)
- Remove players either manually or by disconnect[#43](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/43)

## What I did not do:
- Players can only be removed manually, I will need to develop a serverside feature to disconnect players who leave the site

## Problems I encountered:
- Figuring out websockets was difficult but engaging. They can be as complex or as simple as the programmer desires, so it takes some planning to properly implement.

## Issues I worked on:
- All of the issues above I worked on, which revolved around the similar issue of websockets and client syncing.

## Files I worked on:
- playerview2.html
- server.js


## What I accomplished:
- I now how a system in place for syncing information across clients and the server, which is the larget leap I have made this project. We can now use this to expand and implement the functionality of our program.
