### Issues I planned to fix:
- I added a license to our product so that there is no legal question of whether a person can use or not use our product[#44](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/44)
- I added a useful(or at least I hope useful) mardown file so that people can more easily understand how to use our product[#45](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Tabletop-Stat-Tracker/issues/45)

## What I did not do:
- I was not able to add a whole lot of(or any really) code this sprint. The issue with this is mostly down to the scope of the issues. There was only so much to clean up and to "fix" something would mostly be to just overwrite something that someone else was also trying to fix, ehich is why I took the license and readme work. It was something that would allow me to work and not step on anyone's toes

## Problems I encountered:
- The only real problem I ran into this sprint was making the readme look nice. Markdown is kind of diffcult to make look like something more than just walls of text, expicially when trying to center an image. I simply had to use HTML and some CSS to make that work. Adding the license was pretty simple.

## Issues I worked on:
- All of the issues above I worked on, I also did some other work on some formatting and making some text appear more readable or make more sense in its placement.

## Files I worked on:
- README.md
- license.txt

## What I accomplished:
- I accomplished making the license and readme look presntable and usable for the general public
