## Login Screen
This program is a simple html and css file that would act as the base for a login screen
in our project, with an imported font retro that we would use. 
The user can type their username and password, or register their account if they're new. 
If they forgot their password, that would send them to another page.
If they want their profile to be remembered they can choose that too.
